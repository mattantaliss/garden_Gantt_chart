# garden_Gantt_chart
R script for creating a ggplot2-based Gantt chart for garden scheduling

I wanted a Gantt chart for my garden planning so I would know when I should be planting and harvesting crops. I was dissatisfied with what I found on various websites, and I didn't find any apps that were rated high enough to warrant their cost. So, I just made my own.

The idea with this script is for the user to maintain a master list (data frame) of crops and planting/harvesting times for her/his location. S/he then modifies the list (vector) of crops of interest (e.g., the ones to plant this year) and runs the script to generate a Gantt chart.
